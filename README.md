Stat-Tool
A statistical calculator designed to perform two-sample t-tests (for independent samples) and calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient between two variables.

Features
    T-Test Calculator
        Purpose: Compares the means of two independent samples to determine if they are significantly different.

        Key Features:

            Uses Levene's test to check for equal variances between samples.
        Computes the following:
            Standard errors
            Degrees of freedom
            T-statistic
        Outputs:
            T-statistic
            Degrees of freedom
            Variance of the first variable
            Variance of the second variable
        Dependencies:

            math: For fundamental mathematical operations.
            scipy.stats: Specifically for Levene's test.

    Pearson's Correlation Coefficient Calculator
        Purpose: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
        Output:
            Correlation coefficient (r).

Motivation
This project is an opportunity to:

    Solidify my understanding of statistics.
    Apply and deepen my knowledge of object-oriented programming in Python.
    About the Project
    This is my first project built using Python (or any programming language). I welcome feedback, reviews, and constructive criticisms.

Usage and Reproduction
Feel free to use and reproduce this project, but kindly refrain from pushing changes directly to the main branch.
Thank you!
