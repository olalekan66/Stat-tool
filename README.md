#Stat-Tool
Stat-Tool is a statistical calculator designed to perform two-sample t-tests (for independent samples) and calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient between two variables.

#Features
##T-Test Calculator
Purpose: Compares the means of two independent samples to determine if they are significantly different.

Key Features:

Uses Levene's test to check for equal variances between samples.

Computes the following:

Standard errors

Degrees of freedom

T-statistic

Outputs:

T-statistic

Degrees of freedom

Variance of the first variable

Variance of the second variable

Dependencies:

math: For fundamental mathematical operations.

scipy.stats: Specifically for Levene's test.

##Pearson's Correlation Coefficient Calculator
Purpose: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

Output: Correlation coefficient (r).

#Motivation
This project serves as a personal challenge and learning opportunity to:
Solidify my understanding of statistics.

Apply and deepen my knowledge of object-oriented programming in Python.

This is my first project built using Python (or any programming language). I welcome feedback, reviews, and constructive criticism.

#Usage and Reproduction
Feel free to use and reproduce this project, but kindly refrain from pushing changes directly to the main branch.

#Thank You!
